These certifactes cost hundreds of dollars per year. Can't afford them.

## Antivirus False Positives
Powershell Module [ps12exe](https://github.com/steve02081504/ps12exe) written by [Steve Green](https://github.com/steve02081504) is used to convert the primary script of Gaming Gaiden into native exe.

Some antivirus solutions give false positives for such autogenerated executables. Check the ***Virus Total Scan Link*** for each release and make your own decision.
